## üìå Project Overview
SmartRecruit is a Next.js application that compares a candidate's resume against a target job description using Azure OpenAI. It generates an explainable fit score plus guided recommendations so recruiters and candidates can take immediate action. The project showcases production-ready full-stack patterns for AI-assisted talent intelligence.

## üí° Key Features & Use Cases
- **Skills & Evidence Matrix** ‚Äì Map resume content to role requirements and quantify alignment with a 0‚Äì100 fit score.
- **AI-Powered Insight Cards** ‚Äì Surface strengths, weaknesses, and tailored improvement steps generated by Azure OpenAI.
- **Interview Prep Toolkit** ‚Äì Provide recruiter-facing and candidate-facing questions to accelerate screening conversations.
- **Real-World Use Case:** Recruiters paste a new job description and candidate resume to quickly understand hiring fit and gaps before scheduling interviews.
- **Real-World Use Case:** Candidates analyze their resume against a job post to decide what to emphasize or update before applying.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Docker images are not yet provided. Add a `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` if you plan to containerize the app.

## üìÅ Environment Variables (`.env.local`)
| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | ‚úÖ | Base URL of your Azure OpenAI resource (e.g., `https://my-resource.openai.azure.com`). |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` | ‚úÖ | API key with access to the deployment. |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` | ‚úÖ | Name of the deployed chat model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`). |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` | ‚ûï Optional | Override the default API version (`2024-02-15-preview`). |

## üì∏ Screenshots / Demo

![Uploading a resume](docs/screenshots/upload-resume.png)  
*Candidate uploads a resume or pastes raw text alongside a job description.*

![AI-generated skills matrix](docs/screenshots/skills-matrix.png)  
*Azure OpenAI returns a radar-style alignment across core skill categories.*

![Fit analysis dashboard](docs/screenshots/fit-dashboard.png)  
*Interactive dashboard displaying fit score, strengths, and weaknesses.*

![JSON matrix output](docs/screenshots/json-output.png)  
*Downloadable JSON payload for further analysis or ATS integration.*

**Quick Demo (GIF):** `docs/screenshots/quick-demo.gif` ‚Äì Drag a short GIF here to show the end-to-end flow.

## üß™ How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1. **Resume & Job Intake** ‚Äì Users paste or upload text into the Next.js interface with instant validation feedback.
2. **Data Normalization** ‚Äì The API route trims input, enforces schema, and prepares a structured prompt.
3. **AI Reasoning** ‚Äì Azure OpenAI evaluates overlap between resume evidence and job requirements, producing JSON aligned to the enforced schema.
4. **Post-Processing** ‚Äì The server validates the JSON, clamps scores (0‚Äì100), and normalizes text arrays for consistency.
5. **Visualization** ‚Äì The frontend renders fit score cards, strengths/weakness lists, and interview question buckets.
6. **Actionable Output** ‚Äì Users can copy recommendations, export JSON, or persist the data (ready for ATS or dashboards).

## üìä Example Use Case
**Input**
```text
Job Description Excerpt:
- Senior Frontend Engineer with expertise in React, TypeScript, and accessibility.
- Experience with design systems, automated testing, and mentoring engineers.

Resume Excerpt:
- Led React 18 migration, delivered component library with Storybook and testing via Jest + Testing Library.
- Mentored 4 engineers, improved Lighthouse accessibility scores by 20%.
```

**AI Output (truncated)**
```json
{
  "fit_score": 87,
  "fit_summary": "The candidate demonstrates strong React leadership and testing practices with minor gaps in accessibility certifications.",
  "strengths": [
    "Delivered and maintained a reusable React component library with TypeScript typings.",
    "Mentored engineers and drove team adoption of automated testing frameworks.",
    "Documented accessibility improvements with measurable Lighthouse gains."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "No direct mention of WCAG certification or accessibility audits.",
    "Limited evidence of collaborating with product designers on design system governance.",
    "Does not list hands-on experience with end-to-end testing suites."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add examples of partnering with design to maintain the component library roadmap.",
    "Highlight any accessibility compliance efforts or certifications.",
    "Mention experience with Playwright or Cypress to strengthen testing coverage narrative."
  ],
  "recruiter_questions": ["How does the candidate measure component adoption across teams?"],
  "candidate_questions": ["What accessibility tooling does the engineering org provide by default?"]
}
```

Use this sample to calibrate expectations when demoing to recruiters or tailoring resume updates.
